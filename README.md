<p>Track Your Health:</p>
This site is designed to help patients, especially those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. The site provides the ability to track tests as well as include changes in your health so that you are aware of changes in your body. One of the best services offered is a direct connection between the patient and the nurse and doctor. Thanks to this, the doctor is directly aware of changes in the patient and the nurse is also able to help.<hr/>
<p> In our specific project there is three users</p>
<div>1. Doctor</div>
<div>2. Nurse</div>
<div>3. Patients</div>
